# task-20.10-code-principles
Practicing code principles.

## Learned
 - DRY (IC-RDP-project)
 - KISS (IC-RDP-project)
 - YAGNI (Learning-JavaScript-Course-Task)
 - SOLID (Learning-JavaScript-Course-Task)
 - Semantics (IC-RDP-project)
 - Validity (IC-RDP-project)
 - Linters (IC-RDP-project)
 - BEM (IC-RDP-project)

## Semantics
 - [x] I have checked the semantics of the HTML code in IC-RDP-project and have found no errors.
 - [x] I have checked the validity of the HTML with [the W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) and [found no errors](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fivan-developer-01.github.io%2Ftask-20.10-code-principles%2FIC-RDP-project.optimized%2Findex.html&showsource=yes).

## Linters
I have used these linters to check and format my HTML code in IC-RDP-project:
 - Built-in VSCode formatter
 - Prettier (Didn't configure it but it works from scratch)

## BEM
> **Note**
> I have found that IC-RDP-project already adheres to the BEM principle and thus have not changed the HTML code of the IC-RDP-project for BEM.

## Change list
See at [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).
